In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, and changes in financial position for such periods, have been made. <div style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block;'>&#160;</div><div style='text-align: justify; text-indent: 0pt; display: block; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; margin-right: 0pt;'>Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. The results of operations for the period ended March 31, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results which may be expected for a full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 contains financial information taken from the audited Access financial statements as of that date.</div><div style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block;'>&#160;</div><div style='text-align: justify; text-indent: 0pt; display: block; font-family: Times New Roman; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 12pt; margin-right: 0pt;'>The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, contained a fourth explanatory paragraph to reflect its significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our history of losses and our liquidity position, as discussed therein and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We expect that our capital resources, revenues from MuGard sales and expected receipts due under our license agreements will be adequate to fund our current level of operations into the third quarter of 2012. If we are unable to obtain adequate capital funding in the future or enter into future license agreements for our products, we may not be able to continue as a going concern, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and investors' investment in us may decline.</div></div></div></div><span></span></td>
