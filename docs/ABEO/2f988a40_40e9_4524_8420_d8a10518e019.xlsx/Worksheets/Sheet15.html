As a result of adopting FASB ASC 815, warrants to purchase 3,895,047 of our common stock previously treated as equity pursuant to the derivative treatment exemption were no longer afforded equity treatment. These warrants have an exercise price of $3.50 and expire on November 10, 2013 and February 24, 2014. Effective January 1, 2009, we reclassified the fair value of these common stock warrants, from equity to liability status, as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since origination.</font></div><div style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block;'>&#160;</div><div align=justify style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block; margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 0pt;'><font style='display: inline; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;'>We determined that the anti-dilution provision built into the preferred shares and warrants issued should be considered for derivative accounting.&#160;FASB ASC 815 requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company's own stock to be designated as an equity instrument, assets or liability. Under the provisions of FASB ASC 815, a contract designated as an asset or liability must be initially recorded and carried at fair value until the contract meets the requirements for classification as equity, until the contract is exercised or until the contract expires. We determined that the anti-dilution provision associated with the November 2007 and February 2008 preferred shares and warrants no longer met the criteria for equity accounting through the revised criteria in FASB ASC 815. FASB ASC 815 provides for transition guidance whereby a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings and other impacted balance sheet items as of January 1, 2009. The cumulative-effect adjustment is the difference between the amounts recognized prior to adoption and amounts recognized at adoption assuming this guidance had been applied from the issuance date of the preferred stock and warrants.</font></div><div style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block;'>&#160;</div><div align=justify style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block; margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 0pt;'><font style='display: inline; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;'>Accordingly, at January 1, 2009, we determined that the warrants and the preferred stock conversion feature should be accounted for as derivative liabilities. The preferred stock conversion feature was determined to have no fair market value at both issuance dates as well as each reporting period until the third quarter of 2010 since management asserts that the likelihood of issuing any new equity at a price that would trigger the anti-dilution effect to be nil. During the third quarter of 2010 we were actively raising capital. With our stock price below $3.00 a share it was possible that we would sell shares below $3.00 per share. Since this would require an adjustment to our convertible preferred stock we recorded a derivative liability and expense at September 30, 2010. The derivative liability and expense was revalued at December 31, 2010 and was $5,840,000 and at December 31, 2011 and was $4,430,000. We will continue to reevaluate the derivative liability in future reporting periods and adjust the derivative liability as necessary. The warrants were valued at issuance and each reporting period since using the Black-Scholes model. Both of these derivatives will continue to be marked to market in accordance with FASB ASC 815.</font></div><div style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block;'>&#160;</div><div align=justify style='text-indent: 0pt; display: block; margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 0pt;'><font style='display: inline; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 12pt;'>On January 1, 2009 we reclassified the fair value of the warrants from equity to liability as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since their issue date.
