Pursuant to the 401(k) Plan, employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit ($16,500 in both 2011 and 2010) and to have the amount of such reduction contributed to the 401(k) Plan. We had a 401(k) matching program whereby we contributed for each dollar a participant contributes a like amount, with a maximum contribution of 4% of a participant's earnings in the first eleven months of 2011. The Company suspended matching for the year ended December 31, 2010 and again on December 1, 2011. The 401(k) Plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code so that contributions by employees or by us to the 401(k) Plan, and income earned on 401(k) Plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) Plan, and so that contributions by us, if any, will be deductible by us when made. At the direction of each participant, we invest the assets of the 401(k) Plan in any of 85 investment options. Company contributions under the 401(k) Plan were approximately $40,000 in 2011 and $0 in 2010.</font></div></div><span></span></td>
